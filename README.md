# FetchMeADoc
No More Waiting Lines!" â€“Book an appointment, get diagnosed, receive prescriptions, all online.

Why did we built this?

FetchMeADoc is a paltform where people can book slot for consulting doctors offline and avoid standing quee infront of government hosptials for hours, at the same time the platform also provide an opportunity to people who are living in remote areas to consult doctors of government hosptial online and get prescription. We had also built an android app to get this website and features in single click on peoples phone. We built this project as a part of 24-hrs hackathon called [Medi-Hack](https://medihack.vercel.app/), conducted by [IEEE CS SOCIETY](https://www.instagram.com/ieeesblbscek) and [Teranis](https://www.instagram.com/teranis.lbscek/) on 4,5 May 2024. at [LBS College Of Engineering Kasaragod-Kerala,India](https://lbscek.ac.in).
